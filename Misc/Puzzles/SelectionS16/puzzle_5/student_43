This line is not in its correct location: secondNumber = stdin.nextDouble();
Either delete it or move it past this line: // Read secondNumber
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
Reordered from line 15 to 18: secondNumber = stdin.nextDouble();
Reordered from line 18 to 17: secondNumber = stdin.nextDouble();
