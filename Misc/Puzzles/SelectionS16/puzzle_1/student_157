Your Grade:
You took 33 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
} // End of else-clause
// Declare firstInput
int secondNum;
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
{
// Declare secondNum
else
// Read firstInput
firstInput = stdin.nextInt();
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
{
} // End of if-clause
if( firstInput  <  secondNum )
If ( firstInput  <  secondNum )
stdin.nextInt() = firstInput;
System.out.print( firstInput);
secondNum = stdin.nextInt();
System.out.print( secondNum);
// Read secondNum
int firstInput;
// If firstInput is less than secondNum, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondNum
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program

public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstInput
int firstInput;
// Declare secondNum

// If firstInput is less than secondNum, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondNum
if( firstInput  <  secondNum )
{
