Your Grade:
You took 39 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
// Declare secondInput
// Read firstNum
// Read secondInput
// If firstNum is less than secondInput, print firstNum. Otherwise, print secondInput
}  // End of method main
} // End of else-clause
} // End of if-clause
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
short firstNum
stdin.nextShort() = firstNum;
System.out.print( firstNum);
System.out.print( secondInput);
if( firstNum  <  secondInput )
else
{
firstNum = stdin.nextShort();
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondInput = stdin.nextShort();
{
short secondInput;
short firstNum;
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
short firstNum;
// Declare secondInput

firstNum = stdin.nextShort();
// Read secondInput
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondInput = stdin.nextShort();
// If firstNum is less than secondInput, print firstNum. Otherwise, print secondInput
if( firstNum  <  secondInput )
{
System.out.print( firstNum);
} // End of if-clause

System.out.print( secondInput);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
