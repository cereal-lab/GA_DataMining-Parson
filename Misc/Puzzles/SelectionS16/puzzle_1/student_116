Your Grade:
You took 38 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
// Declare secondNum
// Read firstNum
// Read secondNum
// If firstNum is less than secondNum, print firstNum. Otherwise, print secondNum
int firstNum;
int secondNum;
if( firstNum  <  secondNum )
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstNum = stdin.nextInt();
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondNum = stdin.nextInt();
{
System.out.print( firstNum);
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( secondNum);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
stdin.nextInt() = firstNum;
System.out.print( "Enter the first value")
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
int firstNum;
// Declare secondNum
int secondNum;
// Read firstNum
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstNum = stdin.nextInt();
// Read secondNum
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondNum = stdin.nextInt();
// If firstNum is less than secondNum, print firstNum. Otherwise, print secondNum
if( firstNum  <  secondNum )
{
System.out.print( firstNum);
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( secondNum);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
