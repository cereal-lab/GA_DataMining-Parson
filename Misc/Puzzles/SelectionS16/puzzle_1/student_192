Your Grade:
You took 33 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
int firstNum;
