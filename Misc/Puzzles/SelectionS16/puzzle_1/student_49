Your Grade:
You took 32 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstInput
int secondInput;
// Declare secondInput
firstInput = stdin.nextInt();
// Read firstInput
int secondInput
} // End of if-clause
// Read secondInput
secondInput = stdin.nextInt();
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
// If firstInput is less than secondInput, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondInput
else
}  // End of method main
System.out.print( firstInput);
System.out.print( secondInput);
} // End of else-clause
int firstInput;
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
{
{
if( firstInput  <=  secondInput )
if( firstInput  <  secondInput )
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstInput
int firstInput;
// Declare secondInput

firstInput = stdin.nextInt();
// Read secondInput
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondInput = stdin.nextInt();
// If firstInput is less than secondInput, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondInput
if( firstInput  <  secondInput )
{

} // End of if-clause
