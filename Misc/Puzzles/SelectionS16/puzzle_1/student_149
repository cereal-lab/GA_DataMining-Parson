Your Grade:
You took 32 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 16 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstValue
short firstValue;
// Declare secondNum
short secondNum;
// Read firstValue
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstValue = stdin.nextShort();
// Read secondNum
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondNum = stdin.nextShort();
// If firstValue is less than secondNum, print firstValue. Otherwise, print secondNum
if( firstValue  <  secondNum )
{
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
} // End of else-clause
stdin.nextShort() = firstValue;
{
else
System.out.print( firstValue);
System.out.print( secondNum);
else:
} // End of if-clause
The correct answer is as follows:
