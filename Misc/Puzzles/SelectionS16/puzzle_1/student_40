This line is not in its correct location: firstValue = stdin.nextInt();
Insert this line in its place: System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
This is the code needed to implement this section

The if clause should be executed when firstValue is less than secondInput, not greater than secondInput.
Delete this line: if( firstValue  >  secondInput )
