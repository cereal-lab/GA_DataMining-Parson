Your Grade:
You took 35 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 13 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare value
int value;
// Read value
System.out.print( "Enter the number");
value = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute and print whether value is odd or even
if( value  %  2  ==  0 )
{
else
System.out.print( value  +  " is even");
{
System.out.print( value  +  " is odd");
} // End of else-clause
} // End of if-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
int value
stdin.nextInt() = value;
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare value
int value;
// Read value

value = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute and print whether value is odd or even
if( value  %  2  ==  0 )
{
System.out.print( value  +  " is even");
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( value  +  " is odd");
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
