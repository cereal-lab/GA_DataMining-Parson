The if clause should be executed when value  %  2 is equal to 0 .
Delete this line: if( value  %  2  !=  0 )
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
Moved from solution to trash at line 1: if( value  %  2  !=  0 )
Reordered from line 21 to 20: System.out.print( value  +  " is odd");
