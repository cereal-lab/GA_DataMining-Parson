You took 68 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 34 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare studentCredits
} // End of else-clause

// Read studentCredits
System.out.print( "Enter the credits earned by the student");
// Compute and print the status of the student
if( studentCredits  >=  129 )
System.out.print( "Status is graduate (over 128 credits)");
} // End of if-clause
System.out.print( "Status is freshman (0-28 credits)");
