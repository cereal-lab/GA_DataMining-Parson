Semi-colon after if is an empty statement which becomes the if clause. As a result, the statement(s) after if will be executed whether or not the condition is true.
Delete this line: if( altitude  <=  440 );
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.

This line is not in its correct location: System.out.print( "Exosphere (over 440 miles)");
Insert this line in its place: if( altitude  <=  440 )
This code must appear after else
