== is comparison operator. Use = operator to assign to elevation
Delete this line: elevation == stdin.nextShort();
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
Moved from trash to solution at line 13: elevation = stdin.nextShort();
Moved from solution to trash at line 4: elevation == stdin.nextShort();
