Problem No. 10
Using Template # 2007
Stage: Posttest / Feedback Amount: None / Feedback Type: Demand/Selection.ifElse.Parsons.Single.Simple
The Problem:
System.out.print( secondNum  +  " is a factor of "  +  firstNumber)
System.out.print( "Enter the first number");
} // End of else-clause
System.out.print( secondNum  +  " is NOT a factor of "  +  firstNumber);
firstNumber = stdin.nextDouble();
Else
{
double firstNumber;
else
secondNum = stdin.nextDouble();
{
if( firstNumber  %  secondNum  ==  0 )
} // End of if-clause
double secondNum;
System.out.print( "Enter the second number");
System.out.print( secondNum  +  " is a factor of "  +  firstNumber);

This line is not in its correct location: firstNumber = stdin.nextDouble();
Move this line in its place: System.out.print( "Enter the first number");
This is the code needed to implement this section
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
