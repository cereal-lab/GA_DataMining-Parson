if( firstNum  >  second )
{
short firstNum;
cin >> firstNum;
short second;
{
} // End of if-clause
} // End of else-clause
cout << result;
else
result  =  firstNum  -  second;
short result
cout << "Enter the second number";
short result;
Cin >> firstNum;
cout << "Enter the first number";
result  =  second  -  firstNum;
