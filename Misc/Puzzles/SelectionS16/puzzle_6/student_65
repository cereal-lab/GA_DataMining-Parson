This line is not in its correct location: System.out.print( "Second quadrant");
Move this line in its place: if( location  <=  180 )
This code must appear after else
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
Reordered from line 18 to 17: if( location  <=  180 )
