You took 73 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 36 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare numGrade
short numGrade;
// Declare letterGrade
char letterGrade;
letterGrade  =  'A';
{
else
letterGrade  =  'B';
} // End of if-clause
letterGrade  =  'C';
{
letterGrade  =  'D';
} // End of else-clause
letterGrade  =  'F';
} // End of if-clause
// Read numGrade
