Your Grade:
You took 74 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 36 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare gradeNumber
int gradeNumber;
// Declare gradeLetter
char gradeLetter;
// Read gradeNumber
System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
gradeNumber = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute gradeLetter based on gradeNumber
if( gradeNumber  >=  90 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'A';
} // End of if-clause
else
if( gradeNumber  >=  80 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'B';
{
gradeLetter  =  'C';
} // End of if-clause
else
gradeLetter  =  'D';
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
else
gradeLetter  =  'F';
if( gradeNumber  >=  70 )
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  55 )
} // End of else-clause
{
// Print gradeLetter
System.out.print( gradeLetter);
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
gradeLetter  ==  'C';
{
gradeLetter  =  "D";
{
{
} // End of if-clause
} // End of else-clause
else
} // End of if-clause
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;

{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare gradeNumber
int gradeNumber;
// Declare gradeLetter

} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  80 )
