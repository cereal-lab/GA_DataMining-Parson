Your Grade:
You took 115 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 36 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare numGrade
short numGrade;
// Declare gradeLetter
char gradeLetter;
// Read numGrade
System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
numGrade = stdin.nextShort();
// Compute gradeLetter based on numGrade
if( numGrade  >=  90 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'A';
else
{
if( numGrade  >=  80 )
