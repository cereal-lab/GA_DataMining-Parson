You took 72 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 36 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare numGrade
int numGrade;
// Declare letterGrade
char letterGrade;
// Read numGrade
System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
numGrade = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute letterGrade based on numGrade
if( numGrade  >=  90 )
{
letterGrade  =  'A';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( numGrade  >=  80 )
{
letterGrade  =  'B';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( numGrade  >=  70 )
{
letterGrade  =  'C';
if( numGrade  >=  55 )
letterGrade  =  'D';
} // End of else-clause
else
{
letterGrade  =  'F';
else
{
} // End of if-clause
} // End of if-clause
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
// Print letterGrade
System.out.print( letterGrade);
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
if  numGrade  >=  80
{
System.out.print( letterGrade)
The correct answer is as follows:
