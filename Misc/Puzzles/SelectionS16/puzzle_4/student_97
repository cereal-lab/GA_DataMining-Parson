Your Grade:
You took 26 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 27 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare degrees
int degrees;
// Read degrees
System.out.print( "Enter the location in degrees (1-360)");
degrees = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute and print the quadrant based on degrees
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
} // End of else-clause
{
if( degrees  <  270 )
else
} // End of else-clause
{
if( degrees  >=  90 )
{
System.out.print( "Fourth quadrant");
} // End of if-clause
else
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare degrees
int degrees;
// Read degrees

degrees = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute and print the quadrant based on degrees
if( degrees  <=  90 )
{

} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( degrees  <=  180 )
{

} // End of if-clause
else
