Your Grade:
You took 38 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 13 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare sound
int sound;
// Read sound
System.out.print( "Enter the loudness of sound in decibels");
// Compute and print whether the sound is loud (over 85) or tolerable
if( sound  >  85 )
{
sound = stdin.nextInt();
} // End of if-clause
else
{
sound == stdin.nextInt();
} // End of else-clause
System.out.print( "Sound is tolerable");
System.out.print( "Sound is loud");
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
System.out.print( "Enter the loudness of sound in decibels")
The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare sound
int sound;
// Read sound
System.out.print( "Enter the loudness of sound in decibels");
sound = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute and print whether the sound is loud (over 85) or tolerable
if( sound  >  85 )
{
System.out.print( "Sound is loud");
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( "Sound is tolerable");
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
