Problem No. 8
Using Template # 100
The Problem:

String hexString = input.nextLine();
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}

System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
else
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
if (hexString.length() != 1)
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class HexDigit2Dec {
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
