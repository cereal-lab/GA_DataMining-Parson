Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public static void main(String[] args) {
} while (data != 0);
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
public class TestDoWhile {
Public class TestDoWhile {
data = input.nextInt();
sum += data;
import java.util.Scanner;
}}
do{
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
data = sum = 0;
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
