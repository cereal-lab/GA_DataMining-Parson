Problem No. 9
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
guess = input.nextInt();
else
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");

public static void main(String[] args) {
while (guess != number) {                 // This is line X
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
import java.util.Scanner;

System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
Int guess, number;
