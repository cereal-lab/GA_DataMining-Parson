Problem No. 7
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (isPalindrome)
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
System.out.println(s + " is not a palindrome");
while (low < high) {
while (low < high {
while while (low <= high) {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
else
public class Palindrome {
break;}
low++; high--;
System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
import java.util.Scanner;
isPalindrome = false;
low= 0; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
}
