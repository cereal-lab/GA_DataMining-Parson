The Problem:

System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
else
System.exit(1);}
