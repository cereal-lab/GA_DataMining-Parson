Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
while (guess != number) {                 // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
if (guess == number)
guess = input.nextInt();
else if (guess > number)
public class GuessNumber {
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
}}
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101) // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");
Int guess, number;
int guess, number;
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X

This line is not in its correct location:     guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
Move this line in its place:     int guess, number;
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
