Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public class ComputeAreaV3 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This is line Y
System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +radius + " is " + area);
} }
final double PI = 3.14159;  //This line should be placed before Line Y
double area = radius * radius * PI;
double radius = input.nextDouble();             // This is line X
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: "); //This line should be placed before Line X

This line is not in its correct location:     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This is line Y
Move this line in its place:     final double PI = 3.14159;  //This line should be placed before Line Y
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
