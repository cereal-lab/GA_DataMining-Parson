This line is not in its correct location:     int gcd, k;
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
19. Reordered from line 5 to 10:     int gcd, k;
20. Reordered from line 10 to 9:     int gcd, k;
