Problem No. 6
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (s1.equals(s2))
System.out.println("Neither same content nor same object");
else if (s1 == s2) // This line should be written before Line X
else
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: compareTo method)" );
public static void main(String[] args) {
}}
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) == 0) // This is Line X
String s1 = "Hello World", s2 = "Hello Worlds";
public class StringOperation {
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: equals method)" );
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: equals method)" )
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " are same object");
