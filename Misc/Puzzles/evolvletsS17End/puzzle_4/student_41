Using Template # 100
The Problem:
number1 = 100; number2 = 200;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
int answer = input.nextInt();
System.out.println("You are correct!");
int number1, number2 ;
import java.util.Scanner;
if (number1 - number2 = answer)
if (number1 - number2 == answer)
public static void main(String[] args) {
}}
public class SubtractionQuiz {
public Class SubtractionQuiz {
else
System.out.print ("What is " + number1 + " - " + number2 + "? ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println("Your answer is wrong.\n" + number1 + " - "  + number2 + " should be " + (number1 - number2));
