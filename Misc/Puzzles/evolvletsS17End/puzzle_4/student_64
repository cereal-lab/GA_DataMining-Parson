This line is not in its correct location:     int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
22. Reordered from line 6 to 5:     System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
23. Reordered from line 7 to 6:     String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
