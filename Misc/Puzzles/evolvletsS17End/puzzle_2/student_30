Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
import java.util.Scanner;
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Public class TestDoWhile {
public class TestDoWhile {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
data = sum = 0;
data = input.nextInt();
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
do{
sum += data;
}}
public static void main(String[] args) {
} while (data != 0);
