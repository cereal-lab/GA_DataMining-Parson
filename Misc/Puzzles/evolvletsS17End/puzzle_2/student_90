Public class TestDoWhile {
do{
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
data = sum = 0;
import java.util.Scanner;
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
sum += data;
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
public static void main(String[] args) {

This line is not in its correct location:     } while (data != 0);
Move this line in its place:       sum += data;
