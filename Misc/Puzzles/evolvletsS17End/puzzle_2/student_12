Using Template # 100
The Problem:
do{
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
data = input.nextInt();
sum += data;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TestDoWhile {
Public class TestDoWhile {
data = sum = 0;
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
} while (data != 0);

This line is not in its correct location:     data = sum = 0;
Move this line in its place:     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
