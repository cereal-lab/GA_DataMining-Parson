Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
data = input.nextInt();
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class TestDoWhile {
Public class TestDoWhile {
} while (data != 0);
import java.util.Scanner;
sum += data;
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
data = sum = 0;
do{
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
