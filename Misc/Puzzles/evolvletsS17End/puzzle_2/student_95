Your Grade:
You took 75 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 14 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TestDoWhile {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
data = sum = 0;
do{
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
data = input.nextInt();
sum += data;
} while (data != 0);
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
}}
Public class TestDoWhile {
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TestDoWhile {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
