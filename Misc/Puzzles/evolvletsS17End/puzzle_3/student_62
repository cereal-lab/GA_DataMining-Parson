Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
