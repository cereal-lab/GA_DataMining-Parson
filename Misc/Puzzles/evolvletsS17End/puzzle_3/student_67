Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
public static void main(String[] args) {
else
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
}}
System.exit(1);}
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
String hexString = input.nextLine();
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
public class HexDigit2Dec {
if (hexString.length() != 1)
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
