Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;

if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
else
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
