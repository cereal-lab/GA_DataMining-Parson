Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if if (ch <= 'F' && ch > 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
System.exit(1);}
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class HexDigit2Dec {
String hexString = input.nextLine();
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
