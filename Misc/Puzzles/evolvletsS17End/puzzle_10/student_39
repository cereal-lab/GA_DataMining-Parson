Problem No. 10
Using Template # 100
The Problem:

else if (guess >= number)
else if (guess > number)
if (guess == number)
guess = input.nextInt();
else
}}
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
public static void main(String[] args) {
int guess, number;
