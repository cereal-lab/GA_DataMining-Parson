Problem No. 10
Using Template # 100
The Problem:

guess = input.nextInt();
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
int guess, number;
Int guess, number;
else
else if (guess > number)
while (guess != number) {                 // This is line X
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");
import java.util.Scanner;
}}
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
