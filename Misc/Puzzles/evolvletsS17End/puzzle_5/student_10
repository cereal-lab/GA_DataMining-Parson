System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.print("    ");
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
System.out.print("   " + j);
System.out.println();}
}}

This line is not in its correct location:     for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("    ");
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
