Problem No. 5
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (guess == number)
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");
guess = input.nextInt();
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101) // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
import java.util.Scanner;
else if (guess > number)
}}
while (guess != number) {                 // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class GuessNumber {
Int guess, number;
