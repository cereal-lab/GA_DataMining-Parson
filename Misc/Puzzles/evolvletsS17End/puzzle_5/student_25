Problem No. 5
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.print("   " + j);
public class MultiplicationTable {
System.out.println();}
System.out.print(i + " | ");
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
}}
System.out.print("    ");
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.prcharln("           Multiplication Table");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {

This line is not in its correct location:       System.out.print("   " + j);
Insert this line in its place:     for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
