Using Template # 100
The Problem:

if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
k = 2; gcd = 1;
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
k++;}
gcd = k;
