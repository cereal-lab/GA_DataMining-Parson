Problem No. 5
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2 {
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
if (n1 / k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
int gcd, k;
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
k++;}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
}}
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
k = 2; gcd = 1;
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y

This line is not in its correct location:     int gcd, k;
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
19. Reordered from line 5 to 10:     int gcd, k;
20. Reordered from line 10 to 9:     int gcd, k;
