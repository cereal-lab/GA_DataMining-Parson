Problem No. 5
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
gcd = k;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
public static void main(String[] args) {
k++;}
}}
if (n1 / k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
k = 2; gcd = 1;
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
int gcd, k;
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2 {
