Problem No. 5
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public class MultiplicationTable {
System.out.print("    ");
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
public static void Main(String[] args) {
public static void main(String[] args) {
}}
for for (int j = 1; j < 9; j++)
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
System.out.print("   " + j);
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
System.out.print(i + " | ");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
System.out.println();}
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");

This line is not in its correct location:     for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
Insert this line in its place:     System.out.print("    ");
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
