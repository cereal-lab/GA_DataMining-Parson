Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)

import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
k = 2; gcd = 1;
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y

This line is not in its correct location:       k++;}
Move this line in its place:         gcd = k;
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
19. Reordered from line 14 to 13:         gcd = k;
