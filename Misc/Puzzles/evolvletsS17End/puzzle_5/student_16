String s1 = "Hello World", s2 = "Hello Worlds";
if (s1.equals(s2))
}}
else if (s1 == s2) // This line should be written before Line X
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " are same object");
System.out.println("Neither same content nor same object");
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) == 0) // This is Line X
