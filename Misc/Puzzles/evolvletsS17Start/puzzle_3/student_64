Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public class HexDigit2Dec {

String hexString = input.nextLine();
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
System.exit(1);}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
}}
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void main(String[] args) {
else
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
