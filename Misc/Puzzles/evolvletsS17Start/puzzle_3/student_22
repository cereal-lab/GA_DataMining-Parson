System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
}}
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
String hexString = input.nextLine();
import java.util.Scanner;
System.exit(1);}
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
if (hexString.length() != 1)
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
else
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");

int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(1));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
