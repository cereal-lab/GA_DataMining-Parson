The Problem:
String hexString = input.nextLine();

System.exit(1);}
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
