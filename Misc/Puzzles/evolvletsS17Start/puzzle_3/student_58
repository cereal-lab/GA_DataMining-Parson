Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
import java.util.Scanner;
do{
data = input.nextInt();
} while (data != 0);
public static void main(String[] args) {
Public class TestDoWhile {
public class TestDoWhile {
}}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
data = sum = 0;
sum += data;
