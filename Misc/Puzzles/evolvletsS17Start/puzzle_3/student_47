Using Template # 100
The Problem:

System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
gcd = k;
int gcd, k;
k++;}
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
