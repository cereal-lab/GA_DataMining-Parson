Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
else if (guess >= number)
else if (guess > number)
System.out.print("\nEnter your guess: ");
if (guess == number)
public class GuessNumber {

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101) // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
int guess, number;
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
