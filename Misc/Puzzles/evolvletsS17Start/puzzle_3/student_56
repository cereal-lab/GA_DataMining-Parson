Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
sum += number; // If number is 10 or 11, this line will not execute
if (number == 10 || number = 11) continue; // This is line X
if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class TestContinue {
int sum, number;
}
}}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
while (number <= 20) {
while (number < 20) {
sum = number = 0;

This line is not in its correct location:       if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
Move this line in its place:       number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
