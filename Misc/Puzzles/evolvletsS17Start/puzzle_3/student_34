Problem No. 3
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
public static void main(String[] args) {
if (hexString.length() != 1)
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(1));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
