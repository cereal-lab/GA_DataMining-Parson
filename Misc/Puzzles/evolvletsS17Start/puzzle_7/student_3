Problem No. 7
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("    " + numberOfQuarters + " quarters ");
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 10;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfDimes + " dimes");
public class ComputeChange {
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
int numberOfDimes = remainingAmount / 10;
System.out.println("Your amount " + amount + " consists of"); //After this line, please print dollar first, then quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
int numberOfNickels = remainingAmount / 5;
int remainingAmount = (int)(amount * 100);
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 25;
import java.util.Scanner;
