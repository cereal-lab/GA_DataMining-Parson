System.out.println("    " + numberOfNickels + " nickels");
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 100;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in) //This line should be placed before Line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
Int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
