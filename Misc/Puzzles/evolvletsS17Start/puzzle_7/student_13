Using Template # 100
The Problem:
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
System.out.print(i + " | ");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
System.out.print("   " + j);
System.out.println();}
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
public class MultiplicationTable {
public static void main(String[] args) {
