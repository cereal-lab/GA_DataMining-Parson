Problem No. 4
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
import java.util.Scanner;
int answer = input.nextInt();
public static void main(String[] args) {
int number1, number2;
int number1 number2;
Int number1, number2;
System.out.println("You got it!");
while (number1 + number2 != answer) {
public class RepeatAdditionQuiz {
System.out.print( "What is " + number1 + " + " + number2 + "? ");
answer = input.nextInt();}
}}
number1 = (int)(Math.random() * 10);  number2 = (int)(Math.random() * 10);  // This is line X
System.out.print("Wrong answer. Try again. What is "  + number1 + " + " + number2 + "? ");
