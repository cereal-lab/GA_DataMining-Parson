Problem No. 4
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int sum, number;
if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
sum = number = 0;
sum += number; // If number is 10 or 11, this line will not execute
number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
while (number < 20) {
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum)
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
}}
}
