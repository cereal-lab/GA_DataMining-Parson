Problem No. 4
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public class TestBooleanOperators {
System.out.print("Enter an integer: "); // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 or 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) || (number % 3 == 0)));  // This is line Y
int number = input.nextInt();
import java.util.Scanner;
}}
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) && (number % 3 == 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 1) && (number % 3 == 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y

This line is not in its correct location:     int number = input.nextInt();
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter an integer: "); // This is line X
