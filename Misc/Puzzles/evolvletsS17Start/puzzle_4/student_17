Problem No. 4
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
while (number < 20) {
}}
sum = number = 0;
public static void main(String[] args) {
int sum, number;
number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
sum += number; // If number is 10 or 11, this line will not execute
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum)
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
public class TestContinue {
if (number == 10 || number = 11) continue; // This is line X
if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
