Problem No. 8
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
else
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
String hexString = input.nextLine();
}}
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
System.exit(1);}
public class HexDigit2Dec {
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
