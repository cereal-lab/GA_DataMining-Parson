Problem No. 8
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Public class GuessNumberOneTime {
public class GuessNumberOneTime {
int guess, number;
int guess number;
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");
int guess = input.nextInt();                // This is line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
import java.util.Scanner;
else
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
public static void main(String[] args) {
if (guess == number)
}}
else if (guess > number)
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");

This line is not in its correct location:     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
Move this line in its place: 	guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
