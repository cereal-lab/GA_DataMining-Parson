Problem No. 8
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
System.out.println("    " + numberOfNickels + " nickels");
System.out.println("    " + numberOfOneDollars + " dollars");
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("    " + numberOfQuarters + " quarters ");
int numberOfOneDollars = remainingAmount / 100;
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 100;
System.out.println("Your amount " + amount + " consists of"); //After this line, please print dollar first, then quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
int numberOfDimes = remainingAmount / 10;
}}
int numberOfQuarters = remainingAmount / 25;
int remainingAmount = (int)(amount * 100);
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 25;
System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
double amount = input.nextDouble();
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
int numberOfNickels = remainingAmount / 5;
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 10;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
Int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
