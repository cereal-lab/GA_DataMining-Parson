Using Template # 100
The Problem:

int data, sum;                           // This is line X
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
public class SentinelValue {
}}
sum += data;
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
while (data != 0) {
while (data != 1) {
public static void main(String[] args) {
data = input.nextInt(); sum = 0;
import java.util.Scanner;
data = input.nextInt();}                                                         // This is line Y
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in)  //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
