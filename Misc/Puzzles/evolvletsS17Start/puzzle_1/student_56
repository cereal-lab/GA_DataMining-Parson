Using Template # 100
The Problem:

int guess, number;
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
import java.util.Scanner;
else else if (guess >= number)
else if (guess > number)
}}
else
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
if (guess == number)
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101) // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
