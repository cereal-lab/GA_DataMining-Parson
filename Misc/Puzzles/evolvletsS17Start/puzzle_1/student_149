Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public static void main(String[] args) {
int guess, number;
int guess number;
}}
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
int guess = input.nextInt();                // This is line X
else if (guess > number)
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
if (guess == number)
if (guess = number)
public class GuessNumberOneTime {
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");
else
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
