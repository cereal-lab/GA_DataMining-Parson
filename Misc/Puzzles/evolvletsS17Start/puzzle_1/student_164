Your Grade:
You took 23 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 10 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class AdditionQuiz {
number1 = 10; number2 = 100;
int number1, number2;
System.out.println( number1 + " + " + number2 + " = " + answer + " is " + (number1 + number2 == answer));
int answer = input.nextInt();
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("What is " + number1 + " + " + number2 + "? ");  // This is line X
import java.util.Scanner;
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class AdditionQuiz {
