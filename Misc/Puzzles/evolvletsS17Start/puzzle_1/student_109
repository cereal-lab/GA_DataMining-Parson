Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
sum = number = 0;
int sum, number;
int sum number;
sum += number; // If number is 10 or 11, this line will not execute
if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
}}
while (number < 20) {
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
Public class TestContinue {
public class TestContinue {
number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X

This line is not in its correct location:       sum += number; // If number is 10 or 11, this line will not execute
Insert this line in its place:       if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
