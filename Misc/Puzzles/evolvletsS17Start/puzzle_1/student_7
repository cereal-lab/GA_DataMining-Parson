Your Grade:
You took 40 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 20 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class HexDigit2Dec {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
String hexString = input.nextLine();
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.exit(1);}
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
else
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(1));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class HexDigit2Dec {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
String hexString = input.nextLine();
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.exit(1);}
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
else if (Character.isDigit(ch))
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
else
