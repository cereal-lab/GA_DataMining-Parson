import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println(s + " is not a palindrome");
while (low < high {
while (low < high) {

}}
break;}
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
low++; high--;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
if (isPalindrome)
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
}
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
low= 0; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
