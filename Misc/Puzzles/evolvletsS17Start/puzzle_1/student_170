System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfQuarters + " quarters ");
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 100;
import java.util.Scanner;
int numberOfDimes = remainingAmount / 10;
int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
Int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 10;
double amount = input.nextDouble();
System.out.println("    " + numberOfDimes + " dimes");
System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
int remainingAmount = (int)(amount * 100);
