Your Grade:
You took 51 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 21 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Palindrome {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
isPalindrome = false;
System.out.println(s + " is not a palindrome");
break;}
else
if (isPalindrome)
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
low= 0; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
low= 1; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
while (low < high) {
low++; high--;
while while (low <= high) {
}}
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Palindrome {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
low= 0; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
while (low < high) {
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
isPalindrome = false;
break;}
low++; high--;
}
if (isPalindrome)
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
else
