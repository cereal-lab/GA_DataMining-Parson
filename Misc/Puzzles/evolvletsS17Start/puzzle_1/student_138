This line is not in its correct location:     System.out.println("    " + numberOfOneDollars + " dollars");
Move this line in its place:     System.out.println("Your amount " + amount + " consists of"); //After this line, please print dollar first, then quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
