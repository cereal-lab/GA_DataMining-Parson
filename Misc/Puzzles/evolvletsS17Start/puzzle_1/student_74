Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
break;}
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
public class Palindrome {
System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
while (low < high {
while (low < high) {
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println(s + " is not a palindrome");
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
low++; high--;

This line is not in its correct location:     int low, high, isPalindrome;          // This is line Y
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter a string: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
