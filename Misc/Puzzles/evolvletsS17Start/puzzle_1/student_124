Your Grade:
You took 43 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 11 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class TestBooleanOperators {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("Enter an integer: "); // This is line X
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 or 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) || (number % 3 == 0)));  // This is line Y
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
}}
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) && (number % 3 = 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) && (number % 3 == 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
