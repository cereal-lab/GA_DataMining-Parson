Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public class TestBooleanOperators {
int number = input.nextInt();
System.out.print("Enter an integer: "); // This is line X
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
}}
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) && (number % 3 == 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 and 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 1) && (number % 3 == 0))); //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("Is " + number + " divisible by 2 or 3? " +  ((number % 2 == 0) || (number % 3 == 0)));  // This is line Y
