sum = number = 0;
while while (number <= 20) {
while (number < 20) {
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
number++; //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
}}
int sum, number;
if (number == 10 || number == 11) continue; // This is line X
public class TestContinue {
public Class TestContinue {
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
