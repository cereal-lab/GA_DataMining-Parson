Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (s.charAt(low) != s.charAt(high)) {
low++; high--;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should  be placed before Line Y
else
public static void main(String[] args) {
while (low < high) {
while while (low <= high) {
System.out.println(s + " is a palindrome");
public class Palindrome {
if (isPalindrome)
System.out.println(s + " is not a palindrome");
}
low= 0; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
low= 1; high = s.length() - 1; isPalindrome = true;
String s = input.nextLine();          // This is line X
