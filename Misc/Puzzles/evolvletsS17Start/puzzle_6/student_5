The Problem:
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: "); //This line should be placed before Line X
System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +radius + " is " + area);
public class ComputeAreaV2 {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in)
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
double area = radius * radius * 3.14159;
}}
int radius = input.nextDouble();              // This is line X
double radius = input.nextDouble();              // This is line X

This line is not in its correct location:     double area = radius * radius * 3.14159;
Move this line in its place:     System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: "); //This line should be placed before Line X
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
