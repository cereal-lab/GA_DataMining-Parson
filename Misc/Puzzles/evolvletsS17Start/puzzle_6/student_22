System.out.println("    " + numberOfDimes + " dimes");
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
}}
System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
int numberOfNickels = remainingAmount / 5;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
public class ComputeChange {
