Using Template # 100
The Problem:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public class SentinelValue {
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
data = input.nextInt();}                                                         // This is line Y
int data, sum;                           // This is line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
sum += data;

This line is not in its correct location:       System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
Move this line in its place:       sum += data;
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
