}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
else
guess = input.nextInt();
import java.util.Scanner;
else if (guess > number)
if (guess == number)
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
System.out.println("Your guess is too low");}
