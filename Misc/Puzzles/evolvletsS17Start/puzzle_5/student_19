else if (Character.isDigit(ch))

String hexString = input.nextLine();
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.exit(1);}
