System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
}}

This line is not in its correct location:       k++;}
Move this line in its place:       if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
