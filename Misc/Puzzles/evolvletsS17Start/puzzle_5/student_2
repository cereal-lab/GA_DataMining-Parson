Your Grade:
You took 30 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 15 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class BMIInterprete {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double bmi = 24.60;
if (bmi < 18.5)
System.out.println("Underweight");
else if (bmi < 25) //This line should be written before Line X
System.out.println("Normal");
System.out.println("Overweight");
else if (bmi < 30) // Line X
System.out.println("Obese");
else
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
System.out.println("Underweight")
int bmi = 24.60;
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class BMIInterprete {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double bmi = 24.60;
if (bmi < 18.5)
System.out.println("Underweight");
else if (bmi < 25) //This line should be written before Line X
System.out.println("Normal");
else if (bmi < 30) // Line X
System.out.println("Overweight");
else
System.out.println("Obese");
