Using Template # 100
The Problem:

int gcd, k;
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

gcd = k;
if (n1 / k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
}}
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
k++;}
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {

This line is not in its correct location:     k = 2; gcd = 1;
Insert this line in its place:     int gcd, k;
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
