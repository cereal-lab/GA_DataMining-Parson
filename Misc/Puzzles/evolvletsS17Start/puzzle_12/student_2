public static void Main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +radius + " is " + area);
public class ComputeAreaV2 {
System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: "); //This line should be placed before Line X
}}
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in)
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
double radius = input.nextDouble();              // This is line X
import java.util.Scanner;
double area = radius * radius * 3.14159;
