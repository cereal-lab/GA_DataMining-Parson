Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println(year + " is a leap year? " + isLeapYear);
public static void main(String args[]) {
import java.util.Scanner;
boolean isLeapYear =  (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
boolean isLeapYear =  (year / 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
System.out.print("Enter a year: ");     // This is line X
}}
public class LeapYear {
int year = input.nextInt();
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
