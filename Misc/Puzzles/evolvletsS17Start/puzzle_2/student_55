Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.exit(1);}
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
else

if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
