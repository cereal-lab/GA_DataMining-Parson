Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
int numberOfOneDollars = remainingAmount / 100;
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 25;
public Class ComputeChange {
public class ComputeChange {
System.out.println("Your amount " + amount + " consists of"); //After this line, please print dollar first, then quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
System.out.println("    " + numberOfOneDollars + " dollars");
}}
System.out.println("    " + numberOfQuarters + " quarters ");
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This line should be placed before Line X
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
int numberOfDimes = remainingAmount / 10;
int remainingAmount = (int)(amount * 100);
System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
int numberOfNickels = remainingAmount / 5;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfDimes + " dimes");
import java.util.Scanner;
