Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.prcharln("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
public class MultiplicationTable {
System.out.println();}
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.print(i + " | ");
System.out.print("    ");
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
System.out.print("   " + j);
}}
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {

This line is not in its correct location:         System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
Insert this line in its place:       for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
