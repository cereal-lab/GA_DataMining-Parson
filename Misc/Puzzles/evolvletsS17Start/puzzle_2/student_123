System.out.print("Enter an amount in double, for example 11.56: "); // This is line X
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 25;
}}
int numberOfQuarters = remainingAmount / 25;
System.out.println("Your amount " + amount + " consists of"); //After this line, please print dollar first, then quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 5;
int numberOfOneDollars = remainingAmount / 100;
