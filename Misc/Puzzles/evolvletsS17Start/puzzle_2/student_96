Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public static void main(String[] args) {
}}
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
System.exit(1);}

System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
public class HexDigit2Dec {
String hexString = input.nextLine();
