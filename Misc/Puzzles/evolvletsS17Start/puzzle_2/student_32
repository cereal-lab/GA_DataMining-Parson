Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
if (hexString.length() != 1) {
if (hexString.length() != 1)
String hexString = input.nextLine();
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y

This line is not in its correct location:     char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
Move this line in its place:     if (hexString.length() != 1) {
