Problem No. 2
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int numberOfPennies = remainingAmount;

System.out.println("    " + numberOfPennies + " pennies");
int numberOfQuarters = remainingAmount / 25;
System.out.println("    " + numberOfDimes + " dimes");
System.out.println("    " + numberOfQuarters + " quarters ");
}}
int numberOfNickels = remainingAmount / 5;
public class ComputeChange {
int remainingAmount = (int)(amount * 100);
System.out.println("    " + numberOfOneDollars + " dollars");
remainingAmount = remainingAmount % 100;
