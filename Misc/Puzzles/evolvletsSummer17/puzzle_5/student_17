Using Template # 100
The Problem:
public class MultiplicationTable {
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
System.out.print("   " + j);
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
System.out.print("    ");
}}
System.out.print(i + " | ");
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
public static void main(String[] args) {
public static void Main(String[] args) {
System.out.println();}
for for (int j = 1; j < 9; j++)
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
