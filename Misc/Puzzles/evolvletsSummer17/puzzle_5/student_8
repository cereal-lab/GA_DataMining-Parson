Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
public static void main(String[] args) {

if (hexString.length() != 1) {
import java.util.Scanner;
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(0));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
char ch = Character.toUpperCase(hexString.charAt(1));   //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
