Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int gcd, k;
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void main(String[] args) {

while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in)
k++;}
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
k = 2; gcd = 1;

This line is not in its correct location:         gcd = k;
Insert this line in its place:       if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer
