Using Template # 100
The Problem:
int n2 = input.nextInt();                   // This is line Y
k = 2; gcd = 1;
System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
if (n1 % k == 0 && n2 % k == 0)
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2 {
while (k <= n1 && k <= n2) {
k++;}
gcd = k;
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");  //This line should immediately be placed before Line Y
public static void main(String[] args) {
public static void Main(String[] args) {
int gcd, k;
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X
}}
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
