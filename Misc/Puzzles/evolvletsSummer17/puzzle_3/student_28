Your Grade:
You took 40 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 20 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class HexDigit2Dec {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X

if (hexString.length() != 1) {
System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
System.exit(1);}
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + value);}
if (ch <= 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y

The lines you deleted so far are as follows:

if (ch < 'F' && ch >= 'A') {                           // This is Line Y
The correct answer is as follows:

System.out.print("Enter a hex digit: ");   // This is Line X
