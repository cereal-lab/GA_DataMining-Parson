Using Template # 100
The Problem:

System.out.println("You must enter exactly one character");
int value = ch - 'A' + 10;
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
}}
System.out.println(ch + " is an invalid input");
System.out.println("The decimal value for hex digit " + ch + " is " + ch);
import java.util.Scanner;
