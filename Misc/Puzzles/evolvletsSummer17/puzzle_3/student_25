Your Grade:
You took 28 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 13 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
System.out.println("Neither same content nor same object");
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: equals method)" );
String s1 = "Hello World", s2 = "Hello Worlds";
public static void main(String[] args) {
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) == 0) // This is Line X
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: equals method)" )
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " are same object");
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: compareTo method)" );
if (s1.equals(s2))
else if (s1 == s2) // This line should be written before Line X
public class StringOperation {
else
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
The correct answer is as follows:
public class StringOperation {
public static void main(String[] args) {
String s1 = "Hello World", s2 = "Hello Worlds";
if (s1.equals(s2))
