Problem No. 1
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.println("The area for the circle of radius " +radius + " is " + area);
} }
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //This is line Y
public static void main(String[] args) {
public class ComputeAreaV3 {
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.print("Enter a number for radius: "); //This line should be placed before Line X
double area = radius * radius * PI;
final double PI = 3.14159;  //This line should be placed before Line Y
double radius = input.nextDouble();             // This is line X
