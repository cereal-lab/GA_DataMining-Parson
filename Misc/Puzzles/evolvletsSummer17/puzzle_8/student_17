Your Grade:
You took 31 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 15 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
public class MultiplicationTable {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.print("    ");
System.out.prcharln("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
System.out.print("   " + j);
System.out.print(i + " | ");
System.out.println();}
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
The correct answer is as follows:
public class MultiplicationTable {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("           Multiplication Table");
System.out.print("    ");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++)
System.out.print("   " + j);
System.out.println("\n-----------------------------------------");
for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
System.out.print(i + " | ");
for (int j = 1; j <= 9; j++) {
System.out.printf("%4d", i * j);}
System.out.println();}
