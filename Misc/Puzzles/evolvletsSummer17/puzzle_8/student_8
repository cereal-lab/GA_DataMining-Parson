Using Template # 100
The Problem:
System.out.print("Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): ");
do{
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); // This is line X
} while (data != 0);
import java.util.Scanner;
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
Public class TestDoWhile {
public class TestDoWhile {
sum += data;
data = sum = 0;
public static void main(String[] args) {
int data, sum;   //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
data = input.nextInt();
}}
