Your Grade:
You took 37 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 18 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class GuessNumber {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int guess, number;
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100

else if (guess > number)
System.out.println("Your guess is too high");
System.out.println("Yes, the number is " + number);
}}
The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
else
Int guess, number;
The correct answer is as follows:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class GuessNumber {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int guess, number;
guess = -1; number = (int)(Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
