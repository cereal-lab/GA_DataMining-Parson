This line is not in its correct location:     System.out.println("The greatest common divisor for " + n1 +  " and " + n2 + " is " + gcd);
Move this line in its place: import java.util.Scanner;

Your Grade:
You took 37 steps before bailing out of a Parsons puzzle containing 18 lines of code.
Your answer so far is as follows:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter first integer: "); //This line should immediately be placed before Line X
int n1 = input.nextInt();                  // This is line X

The lines you deleted so far are as follows:
The correct answer is as follows:
