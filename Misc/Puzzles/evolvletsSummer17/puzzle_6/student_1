Using Template # 100
The Problem:
if (s1.equals(s2))
else if (s1 == s2) // This line should be written before Line X

}}
else if (s1.compareTo(s2) == 0) // This is Line X
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " have same contents (Usage: compareTo method)" );
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " are same object");
