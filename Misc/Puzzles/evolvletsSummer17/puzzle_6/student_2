Problem No. 6
Using Template # 100
The Problem:
else
else if (s1 == s2) // This line should be written before Line X
System.out.println("Neither same content nor same object");
String s1 = "Hello World", s2 = "Hello Worlds";
System.out.println(s1 + " and " +s2 + " are same object");
if (s1.equals(s2))
