The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstNum
int firstNum;
// Declare secondValue
int secondValue;
// Read firstNum
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstNum = stdin.nextInt();
// Read secondValue
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondValue = stdin.nextInt();
// If firstNum is less than secondValue, print firstNum. Otherwise, print secondValue
if( firstNum  <  secondValue )
{
System.out.print( firstNum);
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( secondValue);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
