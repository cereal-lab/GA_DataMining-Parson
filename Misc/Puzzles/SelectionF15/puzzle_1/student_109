The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstInput
short firstInput;
// Declare secondInput
short secondInput;
// Read firstInput
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstInput = stdin.nextShort();
// Read secondInput
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondInput = stdin.nextShort();
// If firstInput is less than secondInput, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondInput
if( firstInput  <  secondInput )
{
System.out.print( firstInput);
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( secondInput);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
