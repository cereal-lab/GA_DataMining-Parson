The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare firstInput
int firstInput;
// Declare secondNum
int secondNum;
// Read firstInput
System.out.print( "Enter the first value");
firstInput = stdin.nextInt();
// Read secondNum
System.out.print( "Enter the second value");
secondNum = stdin.nextInt();
// If firstInput is less than secondNum, print firstInput. Otherwise, print secondNum
if( firstInput  <  secondNum )
{
System.out.print( firstInput);
} // End of if-clause
else
{
System.out.print( secondNum);
} // End of else-clause
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
