The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare gradeNumber
int gradeNumber;
// Declare letterGrade
char letterGrade;
// Read gradeNumber
System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
gradeNumber = stdin.nextInt();
// Compute letterGrade based on gradeNumber
if( gradeNumber  >=  90 )
{
letterGrade  =  'A';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  80 )
{
letterGrade  =  'B';
} // End of if-clause
else
