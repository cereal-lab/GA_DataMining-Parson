This line is not in its correct location: gradeNumber = stdin.nextShort();
Move this line in its place: System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
This is the code needed to implement this section
Sorry, your solution is not yet complete and correct.
Please correct your answer

Semi-colon after if is an empty statement which becomes the if clause. As a result, the statement(s) after if will be executed whether or not the condition is true.
Delete this line: if( gradeNumber  >=  90 );
