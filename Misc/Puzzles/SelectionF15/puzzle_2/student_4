The correct answer is as follows:
// The Java program
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Problem
{
public static void main( String args[] )
{
Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );
// Declare gradeNumber
short gradeNumber;
// Declare gradeLetter
char gradeLetter;
// Read gradeNumber
System.out.print( "Enter the numerical grade");
gradeNumber = stdin.nextShort();
// Compute gradeLetter based on gradeNumber
if( gradeNumber  >=  90 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'A';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  80 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'B';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  70 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'C';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
if( gradeNumber  >=  55 )
{
gradeLetter  =  'D';
} // End of if-clause
else
{
gradeLetter  =  'F';
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
} // End of else-clause
// Print gradeLetter
System.out.print( gradeLetter);
}  // End of method main
} // End of class Problem
